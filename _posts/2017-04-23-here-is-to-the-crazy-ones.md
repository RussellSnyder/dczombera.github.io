The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. **Welcome!**

I will use this blog to write down my thoughts, ideas and opinions about technology, the web, OSS, open access and other thinks that I consider as interesting and important.  
  
This blog is based on [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a blog-aware, static site generator written in Ruby.
Its beauty lies in its simplicity. No SQL database. No server to administer. New posts are written in plain old files. And the deployment is a breeze thanks to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and `github-pages` gem.
